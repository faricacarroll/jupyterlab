# Notes

## Notebook

* Add another cell
   * Wants to use control nb 
* Add another function into the cell 
   * Simple 
* Copy the first cell and paste it after the second cell 
   * Says he wants to go the menu using control H 
   * Finds the menu over to the left 
   * Tries the drop down on the top menu bar, starting with notebook 
   * Finds the icon to copy/paste 
* Change the cell type to markdown
   * Tries to do it with control m, finds the drop down at the top 
* Type “hello” in bold and render in markdown 
   * Simple 
* Change from “edit” mode to “command” mode 
   * Doesn’t know how to do it, didn’t notice the color change either to indicate the mode and doesn’t know what the colors mean 
   * Asks what the colors mean, didn’t have an indication 
* Move up and down cells 
   * Clicks on them 
* Try deleting the first cell
   * Scrolls through command palette 
   * Uses “cut” which deletes more cells than he intended 
* Now delete all the cells at once 
   * Says he never figured out how to do that in the notebook, he wants to be able to select all cells at once 
   * Prompt: “shift arrow keys”
   * Gets it 
* Try shifting kernels 
   * Goes to right sidebar 
   * Says the upper right in the notebook will allow kernel switching - ? 
   * Goes back to command palette 
   * Didn’t notice the search bar until now, asks if it was always there 
   * Prompt: “one of the drop downs has switch kernel”
   * Finds it 

## Imagewidget 

* Try uploading an image into a home directory 
   * Tries “file” in the top menu
   * Scrolls through the command palette 
   * Tries using finder 
   * Prompt: “try doing it from within” 
   * Finds “upload file” - success!
* Use Jupyter lab to open the image 
   * Simple right click
* Try zooming in and out 
   * Tries pinch zoom, understands that it is the browser 
   * Says that in some astronomy applications the two finger drag would zoom 
   * Wants there to be a box zoom 
   * Prompt: “use the command palette” 
   * Success! 

# Issues with interface

* Create a more "context sensitive" command palette
* Create a little module with a function that a user that can easily put into new notebooks (grab multiple functions at once from one notebook to another)
