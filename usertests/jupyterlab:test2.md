# Comments

### Jupyterlab
* Import file in context menu of file browser

### Jupyter Website
* Emphasize that it's an interactive computing environment
* This tool is really great at helping scientists setting their goals/hypothesis
   * And keeping track of their steps
* Useful to have a notebook open
   * A gif of someone typing in there
   * Create hypothesis here, create data visualizations here
* Value is in seeing people use it
* What are the problems people facing? Explain how Jupyter has value versus other software in the ecosystem
* Highlight the tools in the Jupyter
   * Would like to see the project architecture
   * Sexy way to show how all the subprojects are related
