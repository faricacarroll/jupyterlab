**Familarity with Jupyter:** Worked with notebooks before, but not Jupyterlab

# Issues with interface:

* Have an indicator of when files are saved
* Improve command palette usability
* Include original notebook arrows in jupyterlab notebook toolbar to move cells up and down
* Include a delete icon on the top toolbar
* 
# Notes

## Notebook

* Open a Notebook
   * Type something: she can’t type in English 
   * Deletes cell and adds with no trouble
* Print “hello world” , copy the first cell and paste it right after
   * “It doesn’t have the arrows” 
   * Hovers over the different menu items at the top 
   * Tries “notebook” then “terminal” then “file” 
   * Still looking, tries command c and command x 
   * Says “I would have expected the arrows which I normally use” 
* Type “hello” in bold and render the markdown 
   * No trouble 
* Insert a cell above the hello
   * No trouble 
* Change from “edit” mode to “command” mode
   * Looks in menu items
   * Hovers over commands, but doesn’t click it 
   * Gives up 
* Move up and down the cells 
   * Doesn’t know what to do other than copy and paste - can’t find any other way to move them 
* Select Multiple cells 
   * Goes to the menu bar at the top again 
   * Clicks different cells 
   * Gives up 
* Delete the first cell
   * No trouble 
* Delete all cells 
   * Goes again to the menu bar at the top (the one by the logo) 
   * Says that since she cannot select all of them, she cannot delete multiple at the same time 
* Change the name of the notebook 
   * Tries to double click the top tab first, then finds the side bar title and changes it there 
* Change the notebook Kernel 
   * Found in 1 click 
* Outside of the notebook, upload an image into the home directory from the desktop 
   * Goes to the top menu bar again. 
   * Still hasn’t opened the command palette once 
   * Gets rid of the screen, goes to the desktop 
   * Looks around the left side bar, still doesn’t click commands
   * Looks in the “editor” drop down menu 
   * Again in “editor” 
   * Goes back to the homepage 
   * Says she would expect it to be able to drag and drop it in

## ImageWidget
* Use Jupyterlab to open an image
   * One click 
* Zoom in and out 
   * Tries doing it with two fingers on the trackpad 
    * Keyboard shortcuts aren’t working 
   * Prompt: “try looking in commands” 
   * Gets it! 

# Comments

"“Having the commands in the side under “commands” is not intuitive. I don’t want to have to scroll through a bunch of commands - it should be simpler than that.”
