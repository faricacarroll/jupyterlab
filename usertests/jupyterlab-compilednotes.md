# User Test: Overall JupyterLab 

## Compiled Notes

Setup: Have Jupyterlab open

* Click on "take a tour" of JupyterLab
* Open a python 3 notebook
   * **Differentiate color scheme with Chrome**
* In the notebook type the following code: print("Hellow world")
* Execute the code
* Open another notebook
* In the second notebook type: print("Hello Scipy")
* Execute the code
* Arrange the open notebooks to view them side-by-side
* Restart the first kernel
   * **Faster tool tip response time for toolbar buttons** 
   * **Functionality to delete cells (users used 'cut' instead of actually deleting the cell)**
* Save your "Hello SciPy" notebook
   * **No User Feedback for saving, should have renaming as well**
* Rename the notebook as "CoolNotebook.ipynb"
   * **Should be able to rename from the top file tab**
* Make a new cell, type x = 2 in the new cell, and run the cell
* Create a new subdirectory in JupyterLab named "images"
* Upload an image from the Desktop to the "images" folder
* Open the image in JupyterLab
   * **Toolbar/Context Menu access for Zoom In/Out**
* Return to your home directory
* Create a text file in a new subdirectory (new folder)
   * **Making a new folder should result in that folder being selected so the user knows to rename it**
* Write "____ is awesome!" in the text file
* Save the file
   * **Users attempt to save by right clicking on tab**
* Launch a python 3 console
* Set (a = 5) and execute the code
* Switch the console to the C Kernel
   * **Is this a necessary functionality? What is an use case of switching to C Kernel versus making a new C console?**
* Close the console
* Open a terminal and type "ls"
* Increase the terminal's font size
   * **Add keyboard shortcuts for increasing/decreasing font size**
* Open the Notebook Tutorial
* Done!
   * **Dedicated help item to show [commands][keyboard shortcut]**
   * **Animation to show keyboard shortcut key sequences**
   * **Images of keys instead of textual representations to make shortcuts more visual/obvious**
